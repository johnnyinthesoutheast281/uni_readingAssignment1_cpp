// Chapter 10: Arrays //

Definition: Arrays are sequences of something of the same type together.

To declare an array, the syntax is : (type) (name of the array)[(number of elements)];

Ex: int arr[5];
        
To initialize the array, we can use the initialization list " {  } " with comma between elements

Ex: int arr1[6] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 0};

The counter of C++ is from 0, so in order to access the n element, we use subscript [(index minus 1)]

Ex: int arr2[3] = {56, 34, 12};
    cout << arr2[2] << "\n"; // This will print out the 3rd element in the array arr2: 12 //

To change the value, for example, of the 1st element of the array arr2, we use the following syntax:

    arr2[0] = 1;
    cout << arr2[0] << "\n"; // This will print out 1 // 
    
    



// Chapter 11: Pointers //

Definition: Pointers are types that can hold the address of a specific object.

To declare a pointer pointing to a specific data type, the syntax is as follow: (data type)* (name of the pointer);

Ex: char* ptr; //declare pointer ptr//

To assign the address of the variable that the pointer will hold, here is an example: 

Ex: int a = 6;
    int* ptr;
    ptr = &a; // The reference symbol " & " means that we take the address of the variable a //
    
Or, it can be :

    int* ptr = &a;

for instance.

To get the value of the address that the pointer is holding: 

Ex: int a = 6;
    int* ptr = &a;
    cout << ptr << "\n"; // This will print out the address that the pointer ptr is holding //
    cout << *ptr << "\n"; // The value of the address the pointer ptr is holding //

To assign another value for a variable using pointer: 

Ex: int a = 6;
    int* ptr = &a;
    cout << a << "\n"; // Print out 6 //
    *ptr = 7;
    cout << a << "\n"; // Print out 7 //

To declare pointer does not point to any object, we use nullptr as follow: 

Ex: int *b = nullptr;





// Chapter 12: References //

Definition: Reference is an alias to an existing object in memory. References must be initialized.

Ex: int a = 1;
    int& b = a;

If we assign another value to either one of the variable, the other will change, too.

Ex: int a = 1;
    int& b = a;
    b = 5;
    cout << b << "\n"; //Print out 5//
    cout << a << "\n"; //Print out 5//
    
 Another concept is const-reference, a read-only alias to some object.
 
 Ex: int a = 1;
     const int& b = a;
